# Test Suite Improvement Task

Your goal is to improve the test coverage and quality of this codebase.

## Objectives:
1. Analyze the existing test suite and identify gaps
2. Increase code coverage to at least 80%
3. Add tests for edge cases and error conditions
4. Ensure all critical paths are tested

## Steps to follow:
1. First, run the existing tests and measure coverage
2. Identify which files and functions have low coverage
3. Write new tests to cover the gaps
4. Focus on:
   - Boundary conditions
   - Error handling
   - Edge cases
   - Main execution paths

## Guidelines:
- Write clear, maintainable tests
- Use appropriate testing frameworks (pytest, jest, etc.)
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Add comments explaining what each test validates

Please analyze the codebase and systematically improve the test suite to achieve comprehensive coverage.

Start by examining the current test coverage and then write the missing tests.
