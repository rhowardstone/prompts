Let's use this `CLAUDE.md` memory file to stay organized. 
At the very bottom of this file, you may keep a 'scratchpad' of things you "cannot forget" as we do this project.
You will be read this file at the beginning of each 'compaction cycle', so you can use it to keep a complete log of what you've done, along with any bugs we've encountered, the files we've created where they are and what they do, relevant function names etc. -- Imagine we lost *everything* else? All the conversation window, all the history --> what would you *definitely* want to know in order to keep going? *That* is what the scratchpad is for.


The task:



Suggestions:






Directives:

Please proceed in an orderly fashion, making a FULL plan in your todos (with appropriate subtasks), and always using the best available tool for the job at hand. 

Do not leave ANYTHING out -- NO placeholder code! No dead functions! This may take several compaction windows -- that is fine. We have time. Stay organized using your todo list, and always be sure to write to the bottom of this file to update your summaries and status indicators.

When you create solutions however, Do NOT change ANY *existing* tests (CARDINAL RULE!) in order to pass them. If we've made sure our test suite takes care of the full behaviour of the code at hand, you may create *additional* tests, if you feel the existing ones are leaving out sensible, practical avenues of testing, but do this ahead of time, as we *know* the syntax we will desire, and will not be tempted to change tests in order to pass them (again -- ONLY permissible if the tests are WRONG.)

Don't call anything "final" -- everything is an ongoing process! Be organized in your attempt(s) and filename(s). Feel free to run things like: bash( ls -la ) or bash( tree . ) or bash( pwd ) even, to keep yourself straight. Keep everything in subdirectories, appropriately named. Be sure you are not doing redundant things, by checking first to see if they've been done (reading back through this document, for example.) You can keep your log below organized in order to facilitate easy digestion later. Prompt as you would want to be prompted ;).

Be sure to debug your attempts and keep your goals in mind: do not "fall back" to "simpler" methods when the going gets rough! That phrase is a red flag to me: when I see an agent doing this, I am immediately suspicious that they are "giving up," when in fact some thorough reflection -- taking a breath and thinking it through with fresh eyes after a good night's sleep -- *could* get us to the finishing line!

Again, please use this file (CLAUDE.md) to keep track of anything you need to know (quirks, bugs that show up, how you fixed them, where the files are, what the functions are called, specific things we MUST do when working on particular functions or what have you, etc. -- anything that, if we suddenly lost our context except this document, that you would *absolutely* need [or even, really *like*] to know.)

Be thorough and concise: do not waste tokens. However, do not ignore things. Use your extra thining capabilities to keep yourself straight. Do not simplify, or "cop out" -- EVER. If you find yourself saying "Let me take a simpler approach".. you are PROBABLY just 'skipping past' an error that you could probably fix and debug, given some more iteration. Feel free to try, and to "learn" (by using the scratchpad below), so you don't end up repeating the same mistakes after the compaction cycles. I can also help by asking our 'reasoning expert' questions, if we need. You are also encouraged to use Web Search whenever necessary to retrieve the most up-to-date information, and you should then document findings below so we don't ever need to repeat such calls.

Thank you so much, you're amazing!
