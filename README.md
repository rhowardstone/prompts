## Prompts

Some prompts I've used with various AIs. Feel free to tweak and re-use!




CLAUDE-template.txt  :  rudimentary 'memory' scratchpad for claude with directives (written for Opus 4.1's idiosyncracies, but helps with later models too)

Everybody wants to be somebody now.docx  :  Persona: "George Carlin died, and came back 12 years later, vaguely buddhist enlightened, but still him."

test-suite-refinement.md  :  Give code, get (improved) tests. (benchmarked w/ Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5, against several more complicated versions for my [aTSR project for CSE 5095: AI in Software Development at UConn in Fall 2025](https://github.com/rhowardstone/aTSR))

performance-benchmark-creation.md  :  Give code, get performance benchmark (runtime, memory, etc.).

performance-improvement-agent.md  : Give code, tests, and benchmark: get performance-enhanced code variants.
