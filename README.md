[CLAUDE-template.txt](CLAUDE-template.txt)  :  rudimentary 'memory' scratchpad for claude with directives (written for Opus 4.1's idiosyncracies, but helps with later models too) [[See my memory DB integration with Claude Code](https://github.com/rhowardstone/claude-code-memory-system) using pre- and post-compaction hooks for a more advanced take on this]

[Everybody wants to be somebody now.docx](Everybody wants to be somebody now.docx)  :  Persona: "George Carlin died, and came back 12 years later, vaguely buddhist enlightened, but still him."

[test-suite-refinement.md](test-suite-refinement.md)  :  Give code, get (improved) tests. (benchmarked w/ Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5, against several more complicated versions for my [aTSR project for CSE 5095: AI in Software Development at UConn in Fall 2025](https://github.com/rhowardstone/aTSR))

[performance-benchmark-creation.md](performance-benchmark-creation.md)  :  Give code, get performance benchmark (runtime, memory, etc.).
