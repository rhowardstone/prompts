## Prompts

Some prompts I've used with various AIs. Feel free to tweak and re-use!

[CLAUDE-template.txt](CLAUDE-template.txt)  :  rudimentary 'memory' scratchpad for claude with directives (written for Opus 4.1's idiosyncracies, but seems to help with later models too)

[Everybody_wants_to_be_somebody_now.docx](Everybody_wants_to_be_somebody_now.docx)  :  Persona: "George Carlin died, and came back 12 years later, vaguely buddhist enlightened, but still him."

[test-suite-refinement.md](test-suite-refinement.md)  :  Give code, get (improved) tests. (benchmarked w/ Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5, against several more complicated versions for my [aTSR project for CSE 5095: AI in Software Development at UConn in Fall 2025](https://github.com/rhowardstone/aTSR))

[performance-benchmark-creation.md](performance-benchmark-creation.md)  :  Give code, get performance benchmark (runtime, memory, etc.).

[performance-improvement-agent.md](performance-improvement-agent.md)  : Give code, tests, and benchmark: get performance-enhanced code variants.

[Adrift.docx](Adrift.docx)  : A novel / screenplay outline that came to me while caring for my mom with dementia and cancer, in a nursing home filled with overworked nurses and aides.

[anthropic-performance-interview.md](anthropic-performance-interview.md)  : A prompt I used when taking the Anthropic performance engineer take-home test. See [https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2014143403144200234](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2014143403144200234). I was an applicant who passed this exam, decided my best shot was delegating to Claude, but didn't get the job. I took this test in October 2025. If you're interested, this is some of the prompting I hurriedly scribbled down the night before, having decided upon that approach. I do not believe I contributed meaningfully to the solutions, beyond orchestration of Claude, but I *was* following along, somewhat.
